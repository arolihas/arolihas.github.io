*Research*: My interests lie in the intersection of machine learning and biotech. Specifically I'm currently focused on geometric deep learning and graph representation learning applied to protein-protein interaction prediction, molecular docking, and generative modeling in structural biology.

*Previously*: I received my M.S. in Machine Learning and B.S. in Computer Science from Georgia Institute of Technology. I interned at IBM, Merck, Novo Nordisk, and Virginia Systems and Technology, gaining experience in software engineering, data analysis, and web development. I studied molecular biology abroad at CPE Lyon and performed research at <a href="https://www.sulchek2.gatech.edu">BioMEMS" and <a href="https://www.bsel.bme.gatech.edu">BSEL</a>.
